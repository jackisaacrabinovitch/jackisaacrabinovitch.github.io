		<h1>About Me!</h1>
		<p>
			I was born in Cambridge and raised in Somerville and Newton (for those not into Massachusetts lore, please read as "just outside of Boston").
		</p>
		<p>
			I live with my wife (and collaborator) <a href="/pages/people.html?person=qian-baoqing">Baoqing</a> in a small west-facing apartment. There is not much room for sunlight but we've been able to make do and currently have a spider plant, an orchid (whose first bloom is pictured in the header image), two lemon bonsais (which we grew from seed), and an innumerable quantity of pothos and succulents.

			I typically go by Jack in English speaking settings, but I am usually refered to as Xiǎo Luó (小羅/小罗) in Mandarin and Jakdan (ᠵᠠᡴᡩᠠᠨ) in Sibe/Manchu. Feel free to read <a href="/pages/more/names.html">more about my names</a>.
