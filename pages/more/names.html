        <h1>My Names</h1>

        <p>My name is Jack Isaac Rabinovitch. I pronounce it like this: [dʒæk ˈaɪzək ɹæˈbɪnoʊvɪtʃ]. Feel free to call me Jack!</p>
        
        <p>I also have a Chinese name: 羅理翔 (simplified: 罗理翔) which is pronounced [lwɔ³⁵ li²¹⁴ ɕjɑŋ³⁵] in Mandarin and [lɔː²¹ lei̯¹³ tʃʰœ̽ːŋ²¹] in Cantonese, and is transliterated Luó Lǐxiáng in pinyin romanization, and Lo Li-Hsiang in Wade-Giles romanization. 羅/罗 is a surname, which originally means 'net for catching small birds', while 理翔, my given name, is composed of 理, meaning 'reason' and 翔, meaning 'to soar'. 歡迎你叫我「理翔」。Among my close friends I often go by Xiǎo Luó (小羅/小罗) 'Little Luo'.</p>
        
        <p>I also have a Manchu/Sibe name: ᠵᠠᡴᡩᠠᠨ which is pronounced [tʃaqtã] in both Sibe and Manchu, and is transliterated jakdan in Möllendorff romanization. It means 'pine tree' and is also the name of a great Manchu translator and poet (who translated one of my favorite books, 聊齋誌異 'Strange Tales from Make-Do Studio', into the Manchu <span style="font-style: italic;">Liyoo jai jy i bithei šutucin</span>). I am honored to have been given this name by one of my Sibe teachers, Kicengge. ᠰᡳ ᠮᡳᠮᠪᡝ ᠵᠠᡴᡩᠠᠨ ᠰᡝᠴᡳ ᠣᠮᠪᡳ᠉ Si mimbe Jakdan seci ombi!</p>
